# War-CardGame
 A java simulation of the card game War. My goal of this repository was to simulate the fully automated game of war in order to collect data on the oscillation between the amount of cards in each hand. There are currently some bugs relating to the war function, including multiple wars or wars when a hand has less than 4 cards.
